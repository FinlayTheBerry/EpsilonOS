# Password Tips

Epsilon OS does a lot behind the scenes to keep you secure but now it's your turn to make an important choice.

Choosing a password is about striking a balance. Pick something too simple, and a hacker might guess it. Pick something too complex, and you'll forget it.

You may have seen websites requiring symbols, capital letters, and other strange rules. Unfortunately, studies show that these kinds of requirements can make passwords harder to remember without providing meaningful security benefits.

What actually makes passwords strong is length. Over and over, research has shown that longer passwords are much harder to crack.

We recommend using a nonsensical or silly sentence as your password.

These kinds of passwords are easier to remember because of how absurd they are and much harder for attackers to guess than short or structured passwords.

Final tip: Avoid using famous quotes or lines from movies, TV shows, books, or songs these are often found in password-cracking databases and can be guessed more easily.


# Security Model

Epsilon OS uses a 2 part password system to keep your device secure without the hassel.

We ask you for both a password and a pin.
The password should be long and ultra secure because you will only need to type it once when the computer turns on.
The pin is for day to day authorizations like aproving an app's request to use your camera.
