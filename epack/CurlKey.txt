An .epack file is really just a .tgz file which contains a manifest.json file.
All epack files use the deflate compression algorithm which is the default for gzip.
All epack files also use the tarball format to store contained files and folders.
The gzip spec supports many compression algorithms but epack only supports deflate.
The tarball spec supports many file permissions but epack restricts most of these.
For exmple extracting an epack file where a random binary has rwsrwsrwx root:root permissions would be a massive risk so obviously permissions are audited and often reset to r-x------ appname:appname for security.
